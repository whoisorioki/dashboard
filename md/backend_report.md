# Backend Achievements & API Status

## âœ… Key Backend Achievements

- **GraphQL-First API:** All major KPIs and analytics are served via a unified GraphQL endpoint. The schema is designed to meet frontend requirements efficiently.
- **High-Performance Data Aggregation:** All backend analytics are powered by the Polars library, using lazy evaluation for optimal performance and memory efficiency.
- **Robust Error Handling:** A consistent error envelope structure and comprehensive logging are implemented across the entire backend.
- **Unified Data Model:** Field names (camelCase) and business logic are consistent across the GraphQL API, ensuring a predictable contract for the frontend.
- **Core Analytics Implemented:** Key analytics, including customer value, top customers, sales performance, and profitability, are fully implemented and return live data from Druid.
- **Reliable Datetime Handling:** Time-based analytics robustly convert and handle the `__time` column, preventing common data type errors.
- **System Health Endpoints:** Functional health and diagnostics endpoints are available for monitoring system status.
- **Dockerized Environment:** The backend is fully containerized for both development and production, complete with health checks and environment configuration.

## API Status

- **Primary API:** The GraphQL endpoint at `/graphql` is the single source of truth for all frontend data.
- **REST API:** Legacy REST endpoints are available but are considered deprecated. All new feature development should use GraphQL.
- **Documentation:** The primary API documentation is now in `md/api.md`, which details the GraphQL schema and queries.

**Summary:**
The backend is stable and robust, successfully serving all data required for the dashboard via its GraphQL API. The focus has shifted from a mixed REST/GraphQL approach to a GraphQL-first strategy, which has been fully implemented.
