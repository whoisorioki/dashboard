# Backend Achievements & API Status

## âœ… Key Backend Achievements

- **GraphQL-First API:** All major KPIs and analytics are served via a unified GraphQL endpoint. The schema is designed to meet frontend requirements efficiently.
- **High-Performance Data Aggregation:** Backend analytics now use Druid SQL for most aggregations, with Polars as a fallback for advanced filtering or legacy endpoints.
- **Robust Error Handling:** A consistent error envelope structure and comprehensive logging are implemented across the entire backend.
- **Unified Data Model:** Field names (camelCase) and business logic are consistent across the GraphQL API, ensuring a predictable contract for the frontend.
- **Core Analytics Implemented:** Key analytics, including customer value, top customers, sales performance, and profitability, are fully implemented and return live data from Druid.
- **Reliable Datetime Handling:** Time-based analytics robustly convert and handle the `__time` column, preventing common data type errors.
- **System Health Endpoints:** Functional health and diagnostics endpoints are available for monitoring system status.
- **Dockerized Environment:** The backend is fully containerized for both development and production, complete with health checks and environment configuration.

## API Status

- **Primary API:** The GraphQL endpoint at `/graphql` is the single source of truth for all frontend data.
- **REST API:** Legacy REST endpoints are deprecated. All new feature development should use GraphQL.
- **Documentation:** The primary API documentation is now in [api.md](api.md), which details the GraphQL schema and queries.

**Summary:**
The backend is stable and robust, successfully serving all data required for the dashboard via its GraphQL API. All new features and integrations should use GraphQL. For API contracts and details, see [api.md](api.md).
