# Automation, Health Monitoring, and Ingestion Best Practices

---

## 1. Automating Druid Health Monitoring

- Use background jobs (e.g., with `APScheduler`, `Celery`, or a simple cron job) to periodically check Druid health via the backend's GraphQL health queries or direct Druid endpoints.
- Integrate with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, etc.) to trigger alerts if Druid is down or unhealthy.
- Log health check results and visualize them in a dashboard (e.g., Grafana, Kibana).

**Example: Python Background Health Check**
```python
import requests
import time
import logging

def monitor_druid_health():
    while True:
        try:
            resp = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/graphql", json={"query": "{ health { druidStatus isAvailable } }"}, timeout=5)
            if resp.status_code == 200 and resp.json().get("data", {}).get("health", {}).get("druidStatus") == "connected":
                logging.info("Druid is healthy.")
            else:
                logging.error("Druid health check failed: %s", resp.text)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error("Druid health check exception: %s", e)
        time.sleep(60)  # Check every 60 seconds
```

## 2. Automating Ingestion Job Tracking

- Use a persistent store (Postgres, Redis, etc.) to track ingestion jobs, their status, timestamps, and errors.
- Expose ingestion job status/history via GraphQL queries.
- Send notifications (email, Slack, etc.) on job completion/failure.

**Example: Persistent Tracking (Concept)**
- On job start: Insert a record with status "running."
- On completion: Update status to "success" or "failed" with a timestamp and error message if any.
- Expose a GraphQL query to list/query jobs.

## 3. Ingestion Frequency: Once or Many Times?

- **One-time ingestion:** For static/historical data loads.
- **Recurring ingestion:** For ongoing, incremental data (e.g., daily/hourly loads, streaming).
- **Best Practice:**
  - Do an initial full load (one-time).
  - Set up scheduled incremental ingestions (e.g., daily, hourly) for new data.
  - Automate ingestion using a scheduler (cron, Airflow, etc.) or Druid's native ingestion tasks.
  - Ensure repeated ingestions donâ€™t create duplicates (use unique keys, upserts, or time-based partitioning).
  - Monitor ingestion jobs for failures, lags, and data quality.

## **Summary Table**

| Scenario         | When to Use         | How to Automate                | Best Practice                |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| One-time         | Historical/static  | Manual/scripted                | Use for initial loads only   |
| Recurring Batch  | Daily/hourly files | Cron, Airflow, Druid tasks     | Automate, monitor, dedupe    |
| Streaming        | Real-time events   | Druid Kafka supervisor, Flink  | Use for high-frequency data  |

## **Recommendation for Your Project**

- Automate health checks (background job + alerting) via GraphQL/Druid SQL pipeline.
- Automate ingestion (scheduled jobs for new data).
- Track ingestion jobs in a persistent store, not just memory.
- Monitor everything (health, job status, data quality).
- Start with batch, move to incremental/streaming as needed.
- All contracts are enforced via codegen and mapping docs. Keep this file in sync with [backend_report.md], [frontend_report.md], and [api.md].
