# Strategic Blueprint for the Evolution of the Sales Analytics Dashboard

## Part 1: Strategic Foundations for a High-Impact Dashboard

### 1.1 From Data Repository to Narrative Guide: A New Design Philosophy
The dashboard will shift from a passive data repository to an active, narrative-driven guide. Each page will follow a three-act structure:

- **Act I: The Setup (High-Level Overview)**
  - Top of each page: critical, "at-a-glance" KPIs to answer "What is the overall state?"
- **Act II: The Confrontation (Insight and Exploration)**
  - Middle: interactive visualizations exploring the "why" behind the numbers (patterns, correlations, anomalies).
- **Act III: The Resolution (Actionable Detail)**
  - Bottom: granular data for specific, informed actions (drill-downs, tables).

This structure will be applied consistently across all pages, transforming them into powerful analytical tools.

### 1.2 Selecting the Optimal Visualization Engine: Nivo
- **Nivo** is the recommended charting library for the redesign.
- Offers a wide array of built-in chart types (Combination, Treemap, Choropleth, Waterfall, etc.).
- Balances ease of use with deep customization, supporting both current and future analytical needs.
- All new and redesigned charts will use Nivo; legacy charting libraries will be phased out.

### 1.3 Establishing a Cohesive Visual System
- **Goal:** All charts must feel native to the Material-UI (MUI) design, including colors, fonts, and dark mode.
- **Color Guidance:**
  - Colors should not be just black and white. The Nivo theme should leverage the full color palette used for KPIs and other dashboard elements.
  - Refer to the different colors of the KPIs (e.g., distinct colors for Total Sales, Gross Profit, Deal Size, Margin %, etc.) to ensure charts are visually engaging and consistent with the dashboard's color system.
- **Implementation:**
  - Create a custom React hook, `useNivoTheme()`, to translate MUI theme tokens—including the KPI color palette—into a Nivo theme object.
  - Use MUI's `useTheme()` to access palette, typography, and KPI color definitions.
  - Map these to Nivo theme properties (e.g., `muiTheme.palette.background.paper` → `nivoTheme.tooltip.container.background`, and use KPI colors for chart series, legends, and highlights).
  - All Nivo charts will consume this hook, ensuring global theme and color changes are reflected in all visualizations.

## Part 2: The Redesigned Sales Analytics Experience: Page-by-Page Blueprint

### 2.1 Overview Dashboard: The 30,000-Foot View
- **Act I:**
  - Four KPI cards: Total Sales, Gross Profit, Average Deal Size, Gross Profit Margin %
  - Each card includes an embedded MUI Sparkline chart
  - Nivo Combination Chart: Total Sales (bars) vs. Gross Profit (line)
- **Act II:**
  - Nivo Choropleth Map of Kenya (shaded by Gross Profit)
  - Nivo Stream Chart (ProductLine contribution over time)
- **Act III:**
  - Enhanced Top Customers Table (ranked by Gross Profit, with row-level sparklines)

### 2.2 Sales Performance Dashboard: From Leaderboard to Coaching Tool
- **Act I:** Team KPIs (Total Team Revenue, Transactions, Active Employees, Avg. Sale/Employee)
- **Act II:** Interactive Sales Employee Table (in-cell Nivo bar charts, row selection for cross-filtering)
- **Act III:**
  - Nivo Grouped Bar Chart (selected rep's sales/profit by product line)
  - Nivo Scatter Plot (Profit Margin % vs. Total Sales; coaching quadrants)

### 2.3 Product Performance Dashboard: Uncovering Portfolio Winners
- **Act I:** Product KPIs (Total Revenue from Top 5, Overall Gross Margin, Most Profitable Category)
- **Act II:** Nivo Treemap (category/product, size=sales, color=margin)
- **Act III:** Searchable Product Details Table (filterable by treemap selection)

### 2.4 Branch Performance Dashboard: A Geospatial Command Center
- **Act I:** Nivo Choropleth Map of Kenya (by Gross Profit, interactive)
- **Act II:** Nivo Bar Chart (branch ranking by user-selectable metric)
- **Act III:** Branch Deep Dive (trend line, donut chart for product mix, top 5 customers)

### 2.5 Profitability Analysis Dashboard: The Story of Your Margin
- **Act I:** Profitability KPIs (Total Gross Profit, Overall Gross Margin %, Net Revenue)
- **Act II:** Nivo Waterfall Chart (Net Revenue → COGS → Gross Profit)
- **Act III:**
  - Nivo Bar Chart (Gross Margin % by product line)
  - Nivo Line Chart (Gross Margin % trend vs. Total Sales trend)

## Implementation Steps
1. **Install Nivo and dependencies.**
2. **Implement `useNivoTheme` hook.**
3. **Refactor each dashboard page to follow the three-act structure and use Nivo.**
4. **Update backend and GraphQL queries as needed for new data requirements.**
5. **Ensure all visualizations are theme-consistent and interactive.**
6. **Update documentation to reflect new architecture and conventions.**
