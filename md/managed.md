# Dashboard Restoration Progress Report

## Backend Achievements

- **GraphQL-First Data Fetching:** All major KPIs and analytics are available via GraphQL, and the backend schema is aligned with frontend requirements.
- **Polars Lazy Evaluation:** All backend aggregations and analytics now use Polars lazy evaluation for performance and memory efficiency.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Consistent error envelope structure and logging are implemented across all endpoints and services.
- **OpenAPI/REST/GraphQL Alignment:** REST and GraphQL endpoints are aligned in naming, field structure, and documentation (e.g., cardName for customers, removal of mock_data, clear response formats).
- **Customer Value & Top Customer Logic:** Both endpoints now group by CardName, use camelCase, and return correct, real data from Druid.
- **Datetime Handling:** All time-based analytics robustly convert and handle __time columns as datetime, preventing Polars errors.
- **Health Endpoints:** System health and diagnostics endpoints are present and functional.
- **Dockerized Backend:** The backend is containerized for development and production, with health checks and environment configuration.
- **Data Pipeline:** The backend reliably ingests, validates, and serves data from Druid to the frontend.
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI docs are updated for all endpoints, with clear response examples and field naming conventions.

## Backend Outstanding Gaps

- **Advanced Analytics Features:**
  - Salesperson Leaderboard (rank by SalesAmount and GrossProfit) not fully implemented.
  - Product Line Profitability (GrossProfit by ProductLine and ItemName) incomplete.
  - Salesperson Product Mix & Margin (average profit margin per rep) not present.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Authentication:** Not implemented in backend.
- **Observability & Monitoring:** No integration with external monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry, etc.).
- **CI/CD & Automation:** Automated integration tests and CI/CD enforcement of codegen/type safety are not yet fully in place.
- **Final Audit & Cleanup:** Some redundant or unused queries/fields may still exist; a final audit is needed.
- **Documentation Gaps:** Some business case/user guide sections are placeholders and need completion.
- **Ingestion Pipeline Automation:** Further automation and monitoring for production robustness is needed.
- **Phase 2 (CRM Data Integration):** Not started; current backend only covers sales data (Phase 1).

## Frontend Achievements

- **Restored Core Dashboard UI:** All major pages (Overview, Sales, Products, Branches) are present and use the latest React and Material-UI patterns.
- **GraphQL Hooks & Type Safety:** All major components use generated GraphQL hooks and TypeScript types, ensuring contract alignment and type safety.
- **Unified Error, Loading, and Empty States:** Standardized components for error, loading, and empty states are used across all charts and tables.
- **KES Formatting:** All monetary values are displayed in Kenyan Shillings (KES) with proper formatting and localization.
- **Global Filter System:** Date range, branch, and product line filters are implemented and integrated across analytics components.
- **Dockerized Frontend:** The frontend is containerized for development and production, with scripts for easy startup and health checks.
- **Health/Diagnostics Page:** System health and diagnostics are surfaced in the UI.
- **Mock Data Fallback:** Clearly indicated in the UI when active.
- **Modern Codebase Organization:** Clear separation of concerns, with business logic in hooks and services, and consistent use of context/providers.
- **Documentation:** Updated for deployment, configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Frontend Outstanding Gaps

- **Advanced Analytics UI:**
  - Salesperson Leaderboard, Product Line Profitability, and Product Mix UI not fully implemented or integrated.
- **Migration to Apache ECharts:** Several chart components still use Recharts; ECharts migration is incomplete.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Authentication:** Not implemented in frontend.
- **Accessibility:** Further improvements needed for WCAG compliance, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation.
- **CI/CD & Automation:** Automated integration tests and CI/CD enforcement of codegen/type safety are not yet fully in place.
- **Final Audit & Cleanup:** Some legacy or placeholder code (old hooks, unused types) may still exist; a final refactor is needed.
- **Documentation Gaps:** Some user guide and business case sections are placeholders and need completion.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Role-specific dashboard views, advanced interactivity (drill-downs, cross-filtering), and further standardization of error/loading states are not yet implemented.
- **Phase 2 (CRM Data Integration):** Not started; current frontend only covers sales data (Phase 1).

**Note:**
- Both backend and frontend are robust and aligned for Phase 1. Remaining gaps are for future improvement and production hardening.
