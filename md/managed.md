# Dashboard Restoration Progress Report

## What Has Been Managed

- The core dashboard UI has been restored and is fully functional, with all major pages (Overview, Sales, Products, Branches) present and using the latest React and Material-UI patterns.
- All monetary values are displayed in Kenyan Shillings (KES) with proper formatting and localization.
- The global filter system (date range, branch, product line) is implemented and integrated across all analytics components.
- All major KPIs and analytics (Monthly Sales Growth, Product Performance, Branch Performance, Revenue Summary, Target Attainment, Top Customers, Returns Analysis, Profitability by Dimension, Branch Product Heatmap) are available and use GraphQL data fetching.
- Unified error, loading, and empty states are present for all charts and tables, using standardized components.
- The backend API is accessible via both REST and GraphQL, with endpoints for all required KPIs and analytics.
- The frontend uses generated TypeScript types and hooks for all GraphQL queries, ensuring contract alignment and type safety.
- Mock data fallback is available and clearly indicated in the UI when active.
- Health endpoints and a system health/diagnostics page are present for observability.
- Dockerized development and production environments are available, with scripts for easy startup and health checks.
- The data pipeline from CSV → Druid → Backend → Frontend is operational, with schema validation and error handling in place.
- All error handling follows a consistent envelope structure, and errors are surfaced to the frontend with user-friendly messages.
- The codebase is organized with clear separation of concerns, and all major business logic is encapsulated in services or hooks.
- Documentation has been restored and updated for deployment, configuration, and troubleshooting.

## What Remains/Not Yet Managed

- Some advanced analytics features (e.g., Salesperson Leaderboard, Product Line Profitability, Salesperson Product Mix) are not yet fully implemented or integrated into the dashboard UI.
- Certain queries and fields in the backend and frontend may be redundant or unused; a final audit and cleanup is needed to remove unnecessary code and queries.
- The migration from Recharts to Apache ECharts for all chart components is not yet complete.
- Role-based access control and authentication are currently disabled or not enforced in the frontend and backend.
- Some error and loading states could be further standardized, especially for edge cases and less common components.
- Observability and monitoring could be enhanced with integration to external tools for production deployments.
- Automated integration tests and CI/CD enforcement of codegen/type safety are not yet fully in place.
- Some documentation sections (e.g., screenshots, user guides, business case summary) are placeholders and need to be completed.
- The ingestion pipeline could be further automated and monitored for production robustness.
- Some legacy or placeholder code (e.g., old custom hooks, unused types) may still exist and should be removed in a final refactor.
