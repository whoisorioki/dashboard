Here is a **checklist of recommendations** to fully integrate into your system, based on the roadmap, blueprint, and your current progress:

### **Sales Analytics Dashboard Enhancement Checklist**

1. **Migrate to Apache ECharts**
   - Replace all Recharts components with Apache ECharts for high-performance, Canvas-based chart rendering.
   - Remove Recharts dependencies.
   - Ensure all chart types (funnel, heatmap, etc.) are supported and performant with ECharts.

2. **Prepare for GraphQL API (Future)**
   - Continue using REST for now, but architect the backend and frontend to allow a future migration to GraphQL.
   - Document current data-fetching patterns and identify areas where GraphQL would reduce over/under-fetching.

3. **Integrate Geospatial Visualization**
   - Add React Leaflet to the frontend for map-based sales analytics.
   - Enable interactive region/branch filtering via the map.
   - Design map components to visualize multi-location/company data.

4. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Design and implement authentication and authorization.
   - Support user roles: sales rep, manager, executive.
   - Restrict data access and dashboard views based on user role.

5. **Enhance State Management**
   - Monitor the complexity of client-side state.
   - If React Context becomes limiting, introduce Zustand for scalable, global UI state management alongside React Query.

6. **Refine UI/UX**
   - Prioritize information hierarchy: place critical KPIs at the top-left.
   - Design role-specific dashboard views for executives, managers, and reps.
   - Enable interactivity: drill-downs, cross-filtering, and exploration features.
