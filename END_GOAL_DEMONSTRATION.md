# ðŸŽ¯ **END GOAL: Upload â†’ Visual Dashboard**

## **OUR OBJECTIVE**

User uploads CSV file â†’ Data appears in dashboard charts and KPIs automatically.

## **CURRENT STATUS**

### âœ… **What Works:**

1. **Frontend Upload Component** - Uses REST API (reliable)
2. **GraphQL Dashboard Queries** - Existing queries work perfectly
3. **Backend Services** - All ingestion services implemented
4. **Druid Integration** - Ready to receive data

### ðŸ”§ **What Needs Fixing:**

1. **Database Connection** - PostgreSQL authentication issue
2. **Background Task** - Needs database to track uploads

## **THE SOLUTION PATH**

### **Step 1: Fix Database Connection**

- Use SQLite for development (simpler)
- Or fix PostgreSQL credentials

### **Step 2: Test End-to-End Flow**

1. Upload file via frontend
2. Background task processes it
3. Data goes to Druid
4. Dashboard queries show new data

### **Step 3: Verify Dashboard Updates**

- Existing GraphQL queries automatically pick up new data
- No changes needed to dashboard code

## **KEY INSIGHT**

The **GraphQL file upload issues** are a red herring. We should use:

- **REST API for uploads** (works reliably)
- **GraphQL for dashboard queries** (already working)

This achieves our goal without the complexity of GraphQL file uploads.

## **NEXT ACTION**

Fix database connection and test the complete flow.
