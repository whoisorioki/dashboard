# Sales Analytics Dashboard: Proof of Concept

## Summary & Strategic Business Case

---

## 1. Executive Overview

### 1.1 Business Challenge

Our organization faces a critical data gap: while we have comprehensive sales data showing successful transactions, we lack visibility into our sales funnel's performance. This creates a fundamental blind spot in understanding why we convert only a fraction of our inquiries into paying customers.

### 1.2 Strategic Objective

This Proof of Concept demonstrates our analytical capabilities using existing sales data which builds an undeniable case for integrating CRM data to unlock the full potential of our sales operations.

### 1.3 Current State Assessment

- **Data Available**: 461,949 sales records (April 2024 - June 2025)
- **Revenue**: KSh 592.6M (January 2025 period)
- **Gross Profit**: KSh 177.6M (30% margin)
- **Missing**: Conversion funnel data, win/loss analysis, sales cycle metrics

## 3. Phase 2: Data Gap Analysis

### 3.1 Current Limitations

#### **Critical Missing Insights**

Our current sales data has a fundamental limitation: **it contains no record of failure**. This creates a 100% win rate illusion that masks our true conversion challenges.

#### **Unanswered Business Questions**

1. **True Win Rate Analysis**

   - **Current Data**: Shows only successful transactions (100% win rate)
   - **CRM Data Needed**: "Successful" vs. "Unsuccessful" conversion tracking
   - **Business Impact**: Understanding actual salesperson effectiveness

2. **Sales Funnel Leakage Points**

   - **Current Data**: No visibility into "Pending" or "Possible" deals
   - **CRM Data Needed**: Deal stage progression and drop-off analysis
   - **Business Impact**: Targeted coaching for specific funnel bottlenecks

3. **Sales Cycle Efficiency**

   - **Current Data**: Cannot calculate time-to-close metrics
   - **CRM Data Needed**: Inquiry date to conversion date tracking
   - **Business Impact**: Identifying efficient vs. stalled deal processes

4. **Lead Quality vs. Salesperson Skill Alignment**
   - **Current Data**: Cannot see failed inquiries
   - **CRM Data Needed**: Full inquiry-to-conversion pipeline
   - **Business Impact**: Optimizing lead distribution and resource allocation

### 3.2 Strategic Business Case (OUT OF SCOPE)

#### **The Conversion Problem**

Based on our current data analysis, we have substantial revenue (KSh 592.6M) and healthy margins (30%). However, this represents only the successful portion of our sales efforts. The real opportunity lies in understanding and improving our conversion rates.

#### **Revenue Impact Potential**

- **Current State**: Optimizing already-successful deals
- **Future State**: Converting more inquiries into paying customers
- **Potential Impact**: Significant revenue growth through improved conversion rates
