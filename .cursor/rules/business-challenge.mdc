description: The goal is to use the data you currently have (the Sales table) to build such a compelling case that your manager and supervisor see the undeniable value in giving you access to the CRM data.  Here is a two-phase plan to do exactly that.  Phase 1: Maximize Your Current Data to Reveal the "What" Right now, your Sales table (from the image of your database schema) is a rich source of information about your successes. It tells you what happens after a deal is won. We will use this data to its absolute limit to create a "State of the Business" analysis. This demonstrates your analytical skill and establishes a baseline that will highlight what's missing.  With your current Sales data, you can build dashboards and reports that answer these critical questions:  1. Who are our most profitable salespeople?  What to do: Create a leaderboard that ranks each SalesPerson not just by their total SalesAmount, but by their total GrossProfit.  Why it's powerful: This immediately shifts the focus from just closing deals to closing good deals. You might find that your top revenue generator isn't your most profitable salesperson. This is a high-impact insight that management will value.      2. What are our most profitable products and product lines?  What to do: Analyze GrossProfit by ProductLine and ItemName.  Why it's powerful: This helps the business understand where its true profit centers are. It answers: "Are we pushing the right products?" and "Are our sales efforts aligned with our most profitable offerings?"      3. Which salespeople are best at selling high-margin products?  What to do: Combine the first two points. Create a view that shows the product mix for each salesperson. You can calculate the average profit margin per salesperson's deals (GrossProfit / SalesAmount).  Why it's powerful: This identifies reps who are skilled at value-selling versus those who might be relying on discounts to close deals. This is a perfect starting point for sharing best practices across the team.  4. What is the profile of our most valuable customers?  What to do: Analyze the AcctName (Account Name) associated with the highest SalesAmount and GrossProfit.  Why it's powerful: This begins to build an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). It tells your team which types of customers are most valuable to the business, which can help focus future prospecting efforts.      By the end of this phase, you will have a dashboard that shows exactly how and where the company makes money from its successful deals. This is valuable, but it's only half the story.  Phase 2: Build the Business Case to Unlock the "Why" Now, you use the insights from Phase 1 to build an undeniable case for getting the CRM data. You will present your findings to your manager and then pivot to the critical questions your current data cannot answer.  This is your pitch:  "I've analyzed our sales data, and I can show you exactly who our most profitable salespeople are, what our most profitable products are, and which customers generate the most value. This is crucial information for understanding our successes.  However, as the CRM dashboard chart shows, our successes represent only a small fraction of our total inquiries. Our biggest challenge isn't optimizing the deals we win; it's understanding why we lose the vast majority of the deals we don't.  Our current Sales data has a fundamental limitation: it contains no record of failure. To solve our conversion problem, we need to analyze our failures. The data that powers the CRM Enquiry Dashboard is the key to doing this."  Here are the critical, revenue-driving questions that only the CRM data can answer:  What is our true Win Rate?  Limitation of Current Data: Your Sales table has a 100% win rate because it only contains won deals.  Why it Matters: The CRM data has "Successful" and "Unsuccessful" conversions. Calculating the true win rate (Successful / (Successful + Unsuccessful)) for each salesperson is the single most important metric for understanding their effectiveness.      Where is our sales funnel leaking?  Limitation of Current Data: You have no visibility into deals that were "Pending" or "Possible" but never closed.  Why it Matters: The CRM data can show if a salesperson is losing deals early (poor qualification) or late (poor closing). This allows for highly specific coaching to fix the exact bottleneck in their process.      How efficient is our sales process?  Limitation of Current Data: You cannot calculate the sales cycle length.  Why it Matters: The CRM data has inquiry and conversion dates. Knowing how long it takes each rep to close a deal helps identify who is efficient and whose deals are stalling, increasing the risk of losing them.  Are we giving the right leads to the right people?  Limitation of Current Data: You can't see the inquiries that failed.  Why it Matters: Perhaps your most effective "closers" are being given low-quality leads that never convert, wasting their talent. Analyzing the full dataset allows you to align lead quality with salesperson skill, which can dramatically increase overall revenue.      By following this plan, you are not just asking for access to more data. You are presenting a strategic initiative. You are showing that you can provide value with what you have, and you are demonstrating a clear, logical path to solving one of the company's most significant problems: turning more of those 1,953 inquiries into paying customers.
